# Nessus client

A ruby library and cli executable for commands on the Nessus 6 REST API.

This library is likely to be incomplete and cover only API calls essential
to Acquia's operational needs.

To use the cli executable, you should have the bundler gem

    bundle install
    bundle exec bin/nessus
